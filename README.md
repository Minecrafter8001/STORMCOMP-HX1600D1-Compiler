Clone the repo, put the compiler.py file in its own folder with an input.txt file that has the assembly code for your program.
Double click to run and copy the two variable names from the output.txt file into the microcontroller (or manually enter them into the computer when it's spawned).
AIRA is the instruction register.
AIRB is the data register.

Instructions on how to use the computer are on its workshop page:
